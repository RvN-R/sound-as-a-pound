## Installing Dependancy's

_Going to suggest opening different terminals to make sure you always start at the route directory_

- Open a new terminal and run `npm ci` to install dependancies from the package.son in route directory.
- Open a new terminal and run `cd server` then `npm ci` to install dependancies from the package.son in server folder.
- Open a new terminal and run `cd client/my-app` then `npm ci` to install dependancies from the package.son in my-app folder.

## Getting started in production

- Open a new terminal and run `cd server`
- Now in the server run `npm run start` this will open port 3001 and start the backend
- Open another new terminal and run `cd client/my-app `
- Now in the client run `npm start` this starts the react server opens it on port 3000
